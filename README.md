# Overview

`modstore` brings the speed python lacked while implementing complex data structures. Leveraging `Rust's` speed, `modstore` brings custom data structures to decrease processing time. Apart from that, `modstore` offers upgraded built-in data structures such as `list`, `dict`, `tuple` and a few new ones like `stack`.

`modstore` started as a data structure library but now also contains algorithms such as sorting and searching.

## Features

`modstore` currently offers the following data structures and algorithms to make your day an easy one:

> **For documentation on a particular topic, click on the topic.**

> **The docs for few topics are still under works, The code itself has docstring(s) in them for ease of use.**

> Here are the basic importing structures for all currently available modules.
> ```python
> from modstore.python import (
>   List,
>   Stack,
>   HashMap, # HashMap
>   AutoHashMap, # HashTable
>   SingleLinkNode, # Singly linked node object
>   LinkedListOne, # Singly linked list wrapper/creator
>   LRUCache, # LRU Cache implementation using LinkedListOne.
>   DoubleLinkNode, # Doubly linked node object
>   LinkedListTwo, # Doubly linked list wrapper/creator.
>   MultiLinkNode, # Coming soon
>   LinkedListMulti, # Coming soon
> )
> from modstore.rust import BlockChain, DAG
> from modstore.algorithms.searching import Search, SearchObject
> from modstore.algorithms.sorting import Sort, SortObject

- [Rust powered data structures](https://d33p0st.in/documentation/libraries/modstore/rust/#libraries "modstore's rust powered data structures")

  `modstore` offers the following `rust` powered data structures:

  - [BlockChain](https://d33p0st.in/documentation/libraries/modstore/rust#blockchain-docs "BlockChain Documentation"): Using Rust's performance, create tamper proof blockchain data structure of your required difficulty. Search through the blockchain and retrieve data in their original form as provided.

  - [DAG](./rust#dag-docs "DAG Documentation"): Directed Acyclic Graphs are graphs with no cycles, used in certain blockchain variants like [IOTA](https://www.iota.org "IOTA Homepage"). Create, manipulate and store Network like data in DAG ledgers.

- [Upgraded Python built-ins](https://d33p0st.in/documentation/libraries/modstore/builtins/#libraries)

  `modstore` has these upgraded built-ins:

  - [List]

- [New Python data structures](https://d33p0st.in/documentation/libraries/modstore/new/#libraries)

  - [Stack]
  <!-- - [HashMap] -->

## Install from scratch
